# Quadmath.jl

[![Travis Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JuliaMath/Quadmath.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/JuliaMath/Quadmath.jl)
[![Appveyor Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/wx46vbwmu2ey5qkj/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/simonbyrne/quadmath-jl/branch/master)

This is a Julia interface to libquadmath, providing a `Float128` type corresponding to the IEEE754 binary128 floating point format.

## Support

Quadmath currently works on x86_64 Linux, macOS, and Windows.

- It may require a new-ish version of gcc which supports `__float128` type.
- It has not been tested on 32 bit Linux.
- It does not work on ARM due to the lack of libquadmath support for that platform.

## Installation
```julia
Pkg.clone("https://github.com/JuliaMath/Quadmath.jl")
```
